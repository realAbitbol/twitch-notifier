A small and lightweight python application that provides Discord notifications when streamers go live but only when they're not streaming certain categories.

Should help you avoid enduring the painful react section of certain streamers.

## 📋 Features

👉 Only sends you one notification a day, per streamer, whenever the streamer streams a non blacklisted category.

👉 Can handle as many streamers as you like, each with a personalized list of blocked categories.

👉 Can be run from source, as well as using Docker.
